
# About the iHeater Project

iHeater is a compact and affordable solution for 3D printers without an active heated chamber or with limited connectivity to the mainboard. It is especially useful for models with proprietary boards where there are no available ports for a fan, heater, or thermistor. iHeater solves this problem in a simple and universal way.

It can operate independently with its own firmware as a standalone device or under Klipper control, connected to the printer via USB.

**Under Klipper Control**

The board works as a separate MCU in Klipper, fully autonomously controlling the chamber heater and fan. Thanks to its 220 V power supply, iHeater does not load the printer’s power supply, which is especially important since stock PSUs often operate at their limit.

The cost of the board is comparable to or even lower than building a similar solution from a regular microcontroller, solid-state relay, and other components. Nevertheless, enthusiasts still have the option to build their own version.

iHeater is a simple way to add chamber heating to your printer to improve print quality and expand the range of materials used.

**With iHeater Firmware**

The iHeater board is self-sufficient and includes all the necessary peripherals and interface for use as a standalone device. The desired temperature is set by sequentially pressing the MODE button, and the selected temperature is encoded and displayed using three LEDs. The increment can be changed in the firmware.

   - Make sure the pins are connected correctly according to the config file.

2. **Install the required files:**
   - Copy the `iHeater.cfg` file to the Klipper configuration directory.

## Flashing Firmware to iHeater

1. **Build the Klipper firmware for stm32f042:**

```bash
cd klipper/
make menuconfig
```

2. **In the menu, select:**

## Klipper Configuration

Copy the iHeater.cfg file to the folder containing printer.cfg and include it using the `[include]` directive:

```ini
[include iHeater.cfg]
```

### 1. Connecting the iHeater MCU

Edit the `iHeater.cfg` file and specify the obtained serial ID:

```ini
[mcu iHeater]
serial: usb-Klipper_stm32f042x6_0C0018000D53304347373020-if000
```

## Usage

### Chamber Heating Commands

- Set chamber temperature:

```gcode
M141 S60 ; Set chamber temp to 60°C
```

- Wait for chamber to reach temperature:

```gcode
M191 S60 ; Wait until chamber reaches 60°C
```

- Stop chamber heating:

```gcode
M141 S0  ; Disable chamber heating
```

- At the end of your slicer’s G-code, add `M141 S0` to properly shut down chamber heating.

## Notes

- **Safety:**
  - Make sure all connections are correct and safe.
  - Check that min_temp and max_temp match your hardware specs.

- **Hardware check:**
  - Test heater and fan operation before use.
  - Monitor temperature during first runs.

- **PID tuning:**
  - Perform PID tuning if precise temperature control is needed.
